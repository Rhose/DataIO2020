SOLUTION: A control device 34 receives a demand for brake pressure through an electric signal and compares it with maximum brake pressure predicted by a Kalman filter in the control device 34 if it can be applied without causing an undesirable skid state. The lower pressure between the pressure demanded to a pilot and the predicted maximum pressure is transferred to a speed limiter in the control device 34. The obtained pressure demand is transferred in the form of a command pressure Pc signal to an actuator 36. The actuator 36 applies pressure to a brake friction material in a brake assembly 38 on the basis of the value of the Pc signal.

The outer convex (14) and inner concave (16) sides of the lens are initially designed according to the Gullstrand Formula. Thereafter, a visual axis (26) of the lens is defined relative to a reference axis (28) of the lens blank (10). In the case of the preferred toric lens, the visual axis (26) of the lens is offset from the reference axis (28). Once the visual axis (26) is defined, the inner concave surface (16) of the lens is modified so as to improve optical quality in a visual center (22) surrounding the visual axis (26). The inner surface (16) of the lens is first defined as a set of reference points (along z-axis) relative to a reference plane (x-y), and then the position of those reference points (along the z-axis) are adjusted relative to the reference plane. By changing the values of these reference points, the inner surface (16) is modified in order to improve optical quality, and particularly astigmatism in the main vision axis (26), but also in the peripheral area. As a result, the modified lens blank (10) has no optical center as it is defined by at least one surface that has no constant radius on any meridian.

US2008046361A2,SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ADMINISTERING RETURN SWEEP ACCOUNTS,"Novel systems and methods for managing a plurality of client demand accounts so as to allow a banking institution to retain client deposits on the bank's balance sheets while, at the same time, providing the client with the capability of implementing up to an unlimited number of transactions per month and also providing the client with interest on their account balances. These objectives are achieved through the use of a pooled deposit account at the client's savings institution or bank. Funds are transferred from individual client demand accounts to the pooled insured deposit account. All or a portion of the interest accrued from the pooled deposit account is then distributed to individual clients. The interest may, but need not, be distributed according to the relative proportions of each client's funds in the pooled deposit account. A database keeps track of deposits to, and withdrawals from, each of the client demand accounts, as well as each client's proportionate and/or monetary share in the pooled deposit account. On a regular, periodic, or recurring basis, a net transaction is calculated as the sum of individual client deposits and withdrawals from the plurality of demand accounts. The net transaction calculation is used to determine an amount of funds that need to be deposited into the pooled deposit account to cover client deposits, or an amount of funds that needs to be withdrawn from the pooled deposit account to cover client withdrawals. Individual account management calculations are performed to determine whether to deposit or withdraw funds from the pooled deposit account to each of a plurality of individual client demand accounts. The database is updated for each client's deposit and withdrawal activities. The invention permits funds to be deposited into a demand account from various sources, and also provides for the tendering of payments from the demand account via different instruments, without limitation as to the number of transfers, and with accrual of interest on the deposited funds. xxnewline",20020208,20080221,19981021,https://patents.google.com/patent/US2008046361A2/en

The basic tenet of capability security is that the right to do something to an object (e.g., invoke a particular object's methods) is represented solely by the holding of a reference to that object. In each of the preferred embodiments described herein, an object is presumed to hold legitimately a reference to a particular object only if the object knows some unpublicized (except under the conditions required by capability security) key associated with the particular object. That is, an object's key is required along with the object's reference. So that capability security is preserved when object references are passed between objects in different processes, the object references being passed are encrypted upon transmission and then decrypted upon arrival at their intended destination. This cryptography can be performed by objects or processes using a variety of techniques, including Diffie-Helman or public/private key cryptography. The cryptography performed in the various embodiments ensures that only the intended recipient of the message can decode the object reference and that a misbehaving object cannot convince another object that it possesses a capability it does not have. Some of the disclosed embodiments provide capability security for distributed object systems wherein the objects and processes directly handle inter-object and inter-process communications and message encryption and decryption. xxnewline",19960701,19981222,19960701,https://patents.google.com/patent/US5852666A/en

The catalyst may, as an option, be added during agglomeration, if that technique is used, as an oily precursor or as a slurry of a somewhat hydrophobic {namosize} nanosize particulate catalyst or catalyst precursor. Short-contact-time reactors providing plug-type flow and high shear are used. The resultant ashy slurry is passed, highly dispersed, into a fluidized or moving bed of solids that may be inert or catalytic at 350-500 DEG  C. and 100-3500 psi where a reducing gas passing up through the bed reductively increases the volatility and decreases the molecular weight of the feed in what is the equivalent of reaction of the feed on each particle in an extremely piston flow manner. As a result, yield loss resulting from coking and gasification of the feed that would be a consequence of too long a reaction time is avoided. The yield improvement is further augmented by the increase in reaction rate that results from the greater area available for transfer of the reducing gas to the film of feed on the particles and from the thinner film through which the reducing gas must diffuse and from the greater catalyst:feed ratio that results from the build-up of catalyst on the particles. A purge of the particulate solids forming the bed passes to a second vessel where its coating may be attrited off the particulate to prepare it for recycle. After or previous to its separation, the coating may be treated to recover energy from its coke content, and catalyst from its ash, all difficult, costly steps in such existing processes as coal liquefaction. xxnewline",19950328,20000425,19950328,https://patents.google.com/patent/US6054043A/en
